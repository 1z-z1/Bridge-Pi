# Bridge-Pi
###### A guide for creating a wireless bridge with a Raspberry Pi B+

So let's get started~

A Raspberry Pi wireless bridge is meant to connect devices that do not have a wireless card/adapter to a wireless network.

The set up guide is going to be foucsed on setting up the SD card for the Rasberry Pi with a Unix-Like system. 
I will be using Arch Linux.

I may expand this section in the future to give more detail for Windows in the future, but for now I recommend using Rufus for writing media to a storage unit on Windows.
