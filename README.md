# Bridge-Pi

###### A guide for creating a wireless bridge with a Raspberry Pi B+
---
Let's get started~

A Raspberry Pi wireless bridge is meant to connect devices that do not have a wireless card/adapter to a wireless network.

The set up guide is going to be foucsed on setting up the SD card for the Rasberry Pi with a Unix-Like system. 

I will be using Arch Linux. I'm sure many different Unix-Like OS's will work too.

I may expand this section in the future to give more detail for Windows in the future, but for now I recommend using Rufus for writing media on Windows.

1. Start by downloading your Raspberry Pi OS [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) for the lastest Raspbian version.

   - I will be using "Raspbian Buster Desktop, Version: February 2020" for this installation.
   
2. Get your sd card + usb adapter together and plug them into your computer.

3. You may or many not have autorun to connect your sd card on your system, for this guide we will assume you don't.
